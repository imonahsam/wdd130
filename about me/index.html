    <p>Hi everyone. I'm unmarried. I am from Benin City, Nigeria. Nigeria is a wonderful place to visit, it's full of diverse cultures and it has beautiful tourist centres.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints for 14 years. The things I love about the church are, Jesus Christ, temples, prophets, etc</p>
    <p>Currently am into Landscaping. I am pursuing a bachelors degree in Web and Computer programming. I love computers so much because of the way it gives exact response to anything it's told to do and other unique qualities it can perform.</p>
    <p>I am so happy to be here with an opportunity to learn more about programming. I am grateful for the opportunity of getting to know all of my classmates. Thank you for looking at my web page.</p>
